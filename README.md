# Introduction
Hi, I’m Samio Ayman — a developer-in-training with a head for code and a heart for adventure. By day, I’m immersed in the world of software maintenance and evolution, learning how to breathe new life into legacy systems. By night, you’ll find me strumming my guitar, dreaming of aviation routes, tuning car engines, or sketching out my next business idea.

I believe great software, like a well-built guitar or a finely-tuned plane, requires craftsmanship, care, and the courage to evolve. I’m here to master the art of maintaining systems that stand the test of time — and maybe one day, build something that flies both in the cloud and in the sky.

🚀 Coding | ✈️ Aviation | 🚗 Cars | 🎸 Music | 📈 Business
